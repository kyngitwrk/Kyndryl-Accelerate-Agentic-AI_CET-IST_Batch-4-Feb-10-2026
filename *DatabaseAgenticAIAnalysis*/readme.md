# Introducing MCP Server for Oracle Database
Model Context Protocol (MCP) was introduced in November 2024 by Anthropic and was met with viral adoption rates. Until MCP, large language models (LLMs) have never been able to directly interact with external data sources and APIs. Instead, the application layer was responsible for orchestrating context augmentation by using the model to enrich user questions with additional information. MCP’s explosive growth comes from the standardization of a protocol used to add context to an LLM. The absence of such a protocol meant that every tool, every API, and so on, would have to create a bespoke implementation for each platform or integration to offer the same functionality. This often led to duplicated efforts across tools and vendors, requiring developers to write custom code for each LLM provider.
    
Oracle evaluated MCP and has integrated it into our core developer tools, making the Oracle Database immediately available on any platform supporting MCP. This integration is made available via our modern command line to the Oracle Database, Oracle SQLcl.

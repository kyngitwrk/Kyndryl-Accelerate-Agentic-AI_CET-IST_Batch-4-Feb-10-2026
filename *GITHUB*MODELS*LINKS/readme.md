    Tools and Model Context Protocol (MCP)
    Workflows use tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP, a standardized protocol for connecting AI agents to external tools and services) for GitHub operations, external APIs, file operations, and custom integrations.

    Agentic workflows (workflows that have agency-the ability to make autonomous decisions) use AI to understand context, make decisions, and generate content by interpreting natural language instructions flexibly. They combine deterministic GitHub Actions infrastructure with AI-driven decision-making, adapting their behavior based on the specific situation they encounter.
